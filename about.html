			<h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
			<h4>Hi, I'm NUR AIN </h4>
			<p>I am Nur Ain, born and grew up in Ladang Tingkayu SDN BHD, Kunak , Sabah. 
				I did schooling and finished my SPM at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Madai, graduated from STPM at the same school in Kunak ,Sabah and am now pursuing degree's in UNISZA. 
				I believe my strength is my attitude, and I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and failure in a balanced way to move forward. 
				I want to say that I am someone who's willing to do anything to be successful as long as what I do is good for me and the people around me. My short-term goal is to find a platform to expand my career and grow with the organization.
				 And my long-term goal is to be the cause of the organization's success. Therefore, I always challenge myself to improve my progress and steady growth.</p>
